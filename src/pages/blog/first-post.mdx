Sorry about that, but this has been for a while I abandoned my old blog due how bad was it, but for now I'm back at 
making new post with all new blog powered by [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) and [Astro](https://astro.build).

## What happened?
Well, it's a bit complex to explain, the issue when I was trying to make my blog looks clean and simple, the current 
styling where either too disorganized or too complex. For example, I was currently working on theme selection out of 
vanilla js, but the issue I had two theme files changing the `@import url()` doesn't work very well, so I tried making 
another new blog, but I wasn't happy with this current implementation, until today I decide to use with this combination.

In this combination it uses [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org) for the styling and [Astro](https://astro.build) for the
framework. I have used the template provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/lkhrs/astro-simple), there's nothing more to
additionally setup everything as it came out of the box. As it was defined simple, not complex.

## What's next?
Good question, I'll probably start publishing some progress in the design term (e.g. Crescent) and bot development. 
Maybe will be, sometimes developing and experimenting new stuff is more or less painful than designing. I'll note down
my ideas and drafting the post (normally unreleased posts, funnily enough you can view them via GitHub XD).
