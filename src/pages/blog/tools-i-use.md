Good morning everyone! If it's the case you don't know how peoples uses any writing tools to create, publish new articles (or post), well I do use tools, unlike others, I'm basically a bit more different in how do I work with markdown. Even writing on an IDE seems a bit very wrong to me[^1], but I'd prefer using an app than using an IDE which I mainly use for Web Development. I'll start showing my list in which apps/tools I use to make these article (like my first post I created).

## Apostrophe
> ### Details
> Platform: Linux

Apostrophe is a markdown editor, it uses `libadwaita` to make it look clean and distraction-free, this is useful for writing the article without being distracted 24/7, even it's easy to use but useful tool to get the app open and start writing, the best thing it does support LaTeX rendering, images, codeblock, table and more. Even it supports spell checking, input format (default is Pandoc, but I'm using GitHub Markdown Flavor).

## Errands

A simple to-do app, which does have the ability to have multiple task lists, add/edit sub-tasks and task. Another addition which help you get organized is adding accent color to each task. Even it does support importing .ics format. Also, it does allow "drag and drop" feature. I do use this app for making tasks or a reminder, even in development stuff.

## Webstorm
> ### Details
> Platform: Windows, Linux and macOS
> 
> Available on: via Installer or [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)

Webstorm is an IDE made by JetBrain itself, which is a full-featured development tool for Javascript/Typescript, it can be extended with plugins and themes, even the markdown support is built-in (expect `.mdx` format requires a separate plugin), it does have "Grazie Lite", with apparently has grammar checking for natural language (e.g. English language), useful for when I check for grammar before publish via Git (built-in tool on IDE).

## My thoughts
These are important two tools which is useful to plan and make new articles, I'd like to keep using as I'm being comfortable with it, but sometimes if I require another tool, I can find one in the app store easily than just suffer myself.

[^1]: This is my opinion after all, but there's people who use IDE as writing tools.
